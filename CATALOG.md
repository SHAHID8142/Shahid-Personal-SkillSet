# Shahid Personal SkillSet - Catalog

Curated for cross-agent robustness. `/sps` routes specialists; it does not stack
every skill at once.

## How to use

```text
/sps [your request]
/sps audit
/sps sync
/sps doctor
```

Portable across skills-compatible coding agents. Not identical everywhere.

## Install profiles

- `core` — recommended
- `full` — core + host extras
- `minimal` — `/sps` only
